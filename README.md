## ⚠️ Important Notice

This script is for educational purposes only. Using this script to bypass software licensing violates the terms of service of Internet Download Manager. We recommend purchasing a legitimate license for IDM.

## How It Works

### Core Functionality

1. **Registry Modification**: The script directly modifies Windows registry entries related to IDM licensing
2. **Trial Reset**: Clears existing registration data to reset the trial period
3. **Fake Registration**: Inserts fake registration details into the registry
4. **File Download Simulation**: Downloads files from IDM's official website to simulate legitimate usage

### Technical Details

The script performs the following operations:

1. **Elevates to Administrator**: Requires admin privileges to modify system registry
2. **Kills IDM Process**: Ensures IDM isn't running during registry modifications
3. **Deletes Existing Keys**: Removes current registration data from:
   - `HKCU\Software\DownloadManager`
4. **Adds Fake Registration**: Inserts fake details:
   - Name: "@Open Source Community"
   - Email: "info@tonec.com"
   - Serial: "FOX6H-3KWH4-7TSIN-Q4US7"
5. **Simulates Downloads**: Downloads files from IDM's website to trigger registry key creation:
   - `https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/images/idm_box_min.png`
   - `https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/register/IDMlib/images/idman_logos.png`
   - `https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/pictures/idm_about.png`
   - `https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/languages/indian.png`
6. **Locks Registry Keys**: Prevents IDM from detecting the fake registration

## New Features Added

### Alternative File Replacement Method

In addition to the registry-based activation, the script now includes an alternative activation method that replaces IDM's core executable files:

1. **File Replacement**: Replaces [IDMan.exe](file:///c%3A/Users/rehan/Desktop/IDM_Activator/IDMan.exe) and [IDMGrHlp.exe](file:///c%3A/Users/rehan/Desktop/IDM_Activator/IDMGrHlp.exe) with modified versions
2. **Automatic Backup**: Creates backups of original files before replacement
3. **Registry Enhancement**: Applies additional registry settings from [registry.bin](file:///c%3A/Users/rehan/Desktop/IDM_Activator/registry.bin) if available
4. **Custom Registration**: Allows users to enter custom registration details

### Version Checking and Download

The script now includes features to check your IDM version and download the latest version:

1. **Version Comparison**: Compares your installed version with the latest available
2. **Direct Download**: Opens your browser directly to download the latest IDM version

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11

## Technical Implementation

### Script Structure

The script is organized into several key functions:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up environment and checks system compatibility
2. **Elevation**: Ensures proper privileges
3. **Detection**: Finds IDM installation path
4. **Registry Operations**: Handles all registry modifications
5. **File Operations**: Manages temporary file downloads
6. **User Interface**: Provides menu and feedback

### Key Components

#### Registry Operations
- Uses Windows Registry commands to modify IDM settings
- Implements permission management for protected registry keys
- Locks keys to prevent detection by IDM

#### File Download Simulation
- Uses IDM's command-line interface (`IDMan.exe`)
- Downloads temporary files from official IDM website
- Files are automatically deleted after use

#### Security Features

### Potential Risks

1. **Registry Modifications**: Changing system registry can cause instability
2. **Software Licensing**: Violates IDM's terms of service
3. **Security Software Conflicts**: May be flagged by antivirus programs
4. **Updates**: IDM updates may detect and remove modifications
5. **File Replacement**: Replacing executable files may affect software functionality

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Backup**: Always backup registry before use
2. **Compatibility**: Only use on supported Windows versions
3. **Monitoring**: Check that IDM isn't running during activation
4. **Firewall**: Use script's firewall toggle if needed
5. **File Backup**: The file replacement method automatically creates backups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

2. **"IDM Not Installed"**:
   - Verify IDM installation
   - Script supports both x86 and x64 versions

3. **Activation Fails**:
   ![Activation Process](images/3.png)
   - Try resetting first (option 3)
   - Disable firewall temporarily
   - Ensure internet connectivity
   - Try the alternative file replacement method (option 2)

4. **Fake Serial Error**:
   - Run reset option
   - Re-run activation

5. **File Replacement Method Fails**:
   - Ensure [data.bin](file:///c%3A/Users/rehan/Desktop/IDM_Activator/data.bin) and [dataHlp.bin](file:///c%3A/Users/rehan/Desktop/IDM_Activator/dataHlp.bin) files are in the script directory
   - Check that IDM is properly installed
   - Verify you're running as administrator

### Advanced Troubleshooting

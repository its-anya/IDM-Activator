## Menu Options Explained

### Option 1: Activate IDM
This is the main activation function:
- Resets any existing registration data
- Applies fake registration details
- Downloads files from IDM's website to simulate usage

### Option 2: Reset IDM Activation / Trial in Registry
Use this to reset the trial period or fix activation issues:
- Completely removes registration data
- Clears trial expiration information

Verifies if IDM is currently activated without performing activation:
- Checks registry for registration information
- Displays current activation status
- Shows registration details if activated
- Displays trial information if applicable

### Option 4: Toggle Windows Firewall
Enables or disables Windows Firewall:
- Useful for troubleshooting activation issues
- May help if previous activators created firewall rules

## Silent Mode Usage

For automated deployment or scripting:

### Activate Silently
```cmd
IDM_Activator.cmd /act /s
```

### Reset Silently
```cmd
IDM_Activator.cmd /res /s
```

## Best Practices

### Before Activation
- Close IDM completely
- Backup your registry (optional but recommended)
- Ensure stable internet connection

### After Activation
- Do not update IDM immediately (updates may remove activation)
- If IDM updates, you may need to re-activate
- Keep the activator script for future use

### For Persistent Activation
- Run the activator after major Windows updates
- Re-activate if IDM shows trial expiration warnings
- Use reset function if you encounter registration errors

## Understanding the Process

### What Happens During Activation
1. **Registry Cleanup**: Removes any existing registration data
2. **Fake Registration**: Inserts new registration details
3. **File Downloads**: Downloads files from IDM's website to create registry entries
4. **Key Locking**: Prevents IDM from modifying or detecting the fake registration

### Files Downloaded
The script downloads these files temporarily:
- `idm_box_min.png`
- `idman_logos.png`
- `idm_about.png`
- `indian.png`

These files are automatically deleted after the activation process.

A: The script itself doesn't contain malware, but it does modify system registry settings which always carries some risk. Use at your own discretion.

A: It should work with most versions, but IDM periodically updates their anti-tampering measures which may affect the script's effectiveness.

### Q: Do I need to run this every time I start my computer?
